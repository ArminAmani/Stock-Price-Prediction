# Stock-Price-Prediction

# LSTM Time Series
In this project, we use historical stock market data to train an LSTM model. The model learns from past price patterns and trends, enabling it to predict future stock prices. The LSTM network is specifically designed to capture long-term dependencies and has proventer than to be more effective than RNN.

## Dataset üìä
We use a publicly available dataset. The dataset includes features like opening price, closing price, volume, etc. We preprocess the data, splitting it into training and testing sets, and perform any necessary data transformations.
